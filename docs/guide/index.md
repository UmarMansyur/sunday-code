# Introduction

### What is Sunday Code Camp?

Sunday Code Camp is event for students of informatics at the Unira of 2021 organized by ProJS. Sunday Code Camp exists because of concerns of Unira students which are not found aspiring JavaScript developer. __`Nazir Arifin`__ as a lecturer of Unira, and also a JavaScript developer, decided to create Sunday Code Camp to help students to learn JavaScript. He hopes that Sunday Code Camp can become a place for students to learn JavaScript and also to share knowledge with other students. 

Sunday code camp will last for 4 weeks. In the first week, we will learn about html and css. In the second week, we will learn about grid & flexbox. In the third week, we will learn about JavaScript, DOM, Promise, Async Await & Fetch Api. In the fourth week, we will learn about NodeJS (expressJs).

The material that has been prepared will be presented in a more structured and systematic way. The material will be presented in the form of a workshop, which will be presented by the lecturer and the students themselves. In addition, there will also be a discussion session, where students can ask questions about the material that has been presented. In final session, there will be a project session, where students can work together to create a project. Besides that, the material will also be presented in the form of documentation, which will be presented in the form of a website. This documentation will be updated regularly, so that students can always refer to it.
